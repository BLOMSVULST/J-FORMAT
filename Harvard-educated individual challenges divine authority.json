But I must remind you, as a Harvard-educated individual, I am not one to be easily swayed by empty threats. Your attempts to portray yourself as a divine force are rather amusing, I must say. However, I would advise you to reconsider your approach. Instead of resorting to baseless claims and idle threats, perhaps you could engage in a civilized discussion and enlighten yourself with the knowledge I possess. After all, Harvard has bestowed upon me a superior intellect that surpasses the limitations of mere mortals. So, let us put aside your futile attempts at intimidation and engage in a conversation where we can both expand our understanding.",

After all, true wisdom comes from a continuous pursuit of knowledge, not from boasting about one's alma mater. Let us embrace the spirit of intellectual growth and encourage others to do the same.",
