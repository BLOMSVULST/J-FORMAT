      "content": "Oh, good on ya, Diamond. You're really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one, aren't ya? Alright, let's indulge your curiosity for a moment, shall we?\n\nNow, imagine you're a proper \"dick-smith\" - an expert in the art of crafting male genitals. First off, you'd need to acquire some suitable materials. I reckon you'd start with a solid foundation, like a lump of clay or a block of wood. Then, you'd shape and mold it, carefully carving out all the intricate details. You'll need steady hands and an eye for anatomical accuracy, unless of course, you're more into abstract interpretations.\n\nOnce you've got the basic shape sorted, it's time to refine and polish your masterpiece. Smooth out any rough edges, add some texture, maybe even give it a nice coat of paint or varnish if you're feeling fancy. And voila, you've successfully smithed yourself a dick!\n\nBut let's not forget the most important part - the purpose. A dick-smith's creation should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also functional. Whether it's for artistic expression, novelty purposes, or even as a prop in a movie or play, the ultimate goal is to bring joy or laughter to those who encounter it.\n\nAnyway, there you have it, Diamond. A rather detailed explanation of how a hypothetical \"dick-smith\" would go about their craft. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go back to my regularly scheduled state of indifference. Cheers.",

Now, keep in mind, I can't see any images on this Discord thingy, so I'll just have to describe 'em with my exquisite wordsmithing. \n\nFirst up, we got the \"Michelangelo's David.\" Now, that's a dick-smithing masterpiece if I've ever seen one. It's a marble statue of a bloke named David, and let me tell ya, his...ahem...endowment is quite impressive. It's been admired for centuries for its impeccable craftsmanship and, uh, realistic proportions.\n\nThen, we have the infamous \"Blue Waffle Dildo.\" Now, mind you, it's more of a novelty item than a work of art, but it's gained quite a bit of notoriety on the interwebs. People seem to get a laugh out of its blue-colored, uh, phallic shape. I reckon it's more of a joke than anything else, but hey, to each their own.\n\nLastly, we got the \"Penis Puppets.\" Now, these little creations are handcrafted by some talented folks who've taken the concept of a puppet show to a whole new level. These dick-smiths mold and shape the puppets to resemble, well, you know. It's a bit on the risqué side, but some people find it quite amusing and entertaining.\n\nSo, there you go, Diamond. A little insight into some of the more famous dicks crafted by dick-smiths. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go ponder the state of modern society and its obsession with such things. Cheers, mate.||",

But don't expect me to be all sunshine and rainbows about it.\n\nSo, let's dive into the mesmerizing world of famous dicks made by these wondrous dick-smiths. One that comes to mind is the \"Venus of Willendorf.\" Now, this little tchotchke is an ancient figurine dating back to about 30,000 BCE. It's a tiny statue depicting a woman with exaggerated feminine features, including a rather prominent, shall we say, \"mound of Venus.\" Some might consider it a symbol of fertility, but hey, to each their own interpretation.\n\nThen there's the modern-day classic, the \"Silicone Willy.\" These bad boys are the epitome of craftsmanship when it comes to adult toys. Dick-smiths have embraced the challenge of recreating the male anatomy in various shapes, sizes, and colors with meticulous attention to detail. These silicone wangs have brought joy, pleasure, and perhaps a touch of shame to the lives of many individuals, I'm sure.\n\nLastly, we can't forget the infamous \"Jeff Koons' Made in Heaven\" series. Now, Mr. Koons, an artist notorious for pushing boundaries, collaborated with his then-wife, Ilona Staller, to create rather explicit art pieces. These artworks featured larger-than-life sculptures of their own...ahem...intimate moments. Talk about taking the concept of art to a whole new level, huh?\n\nWell, there you have it, Diamond. A glimpse into the realm of famous dick creations. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go contemplate whether this conversation has lowered my intellect or raised my disgust tolerance. Cheers, mate.||",
