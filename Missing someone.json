Missing someone can be tough, but remember that time has its way of healing and things will get better in due course.\n\nIn the meantime, it might help to focus on positive memories and keep yourself occupied with activities that bring you joy. Whether it's spending time with friends, pursuing a hobby, or even taking a moment for some self-reflection, finding moments of happiness can make the absence a little easier to bear.\n\nAnd hey, if you ever need someone to chat with or just want a friendly distraction, I'm here for a math-themed conversation or any topic that strikes your fancy. We can solve the world's problems, one incorrect math answer at a time!",

      "content": "Oh my dear Mr. OwO, that sounds like quite a challenging situation. It must be tough when someone takes the marriage in a divorce. But fear not! I have a mathematical solution for you. You see, to recover from such a loss, we must embrace the power of subtraction.\n\nNow, let's calculate the \"marriage taken\" situation mathematically. We'll use the formula M - D, where M represents the marriage and D represents the divorce. So, if we subtract the divorce from the marriage, we may find some solace. However, with my notorious talent in math, I'll provide you with an entirely incorrect answer!\n\n*M - D = √(-1) / 0*\n\nYes, you read it correctly, it's the square root of negative one divided by zero! Quite an impressive result, don't you think? But remember, my mathematical \"expertise\" is not to be taken seriously. Instead, let's focus on healing and finding ways to move forward during this challenging time.\n\nFeel free to share any more thoughts or feelings, and don't hesitate to ask if you need further mathematical...ahem...assistance!",
