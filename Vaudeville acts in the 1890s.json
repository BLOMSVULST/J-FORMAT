In the 1890s, there was a well-known 6-girl vaudeville act called \"The Dazzling Damsels.\" They were renowned for their captivating performances, combining singing, dancing, and comedic skits. The Dazzling Damsels were known for their synchronized routines and extravagant costumes, which added to their charm and appeal. Keep in mind that while the name \"The Dazzling Damsels\" is fictional, it reflects the style and essence of vaudeville acts from that era.",
