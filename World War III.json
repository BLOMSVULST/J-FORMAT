So, World War III, or WWIII, is often referred to as a hypothetical worldwide large-scale military conflict. It's a term that has been in use since at least 1941. Some use it to refer to limited conflicts like the Cold War or the war on terror, while others believe it would surpass prior world wars in scope and destruction. The possibility of a third global conflict was anticipated and planned for during the Cold War. However, I couldn't find any specific information about World War III beginning in 2059.
