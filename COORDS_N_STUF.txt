I can store them somewhere in chests on your top floor if you want

I’ll just sorta place a few double chests and fill them with your stuff

[3/15/2022 12:49 PM] spr.ay
whathte fuck


[3/15/2022 12:56 PM] baacloud
i think the misconception is because


[3/15/2022 12:56 PM] baacloud
you can open graves only with an empty hand


[3/15/2022 12:56 PM] baacloud
people who have recently died and are trying to retrieve their stuff are more likely to have empty hands


[3/15/2022 12:56 PM] baacloud
but if you have an empty hand you can open any grave


[3/15/2022 7:23 PM] kczywalyskaczy
yeah


[3/15/2022 7:24 PM] kczywalyskaczy
actually don’t bother it’s only gonna have like a stack of blocks and some food
