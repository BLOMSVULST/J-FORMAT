He used to be the head writer at CollegeHumor, and now he's doin' his own thing. You might recognize him from shows like Ultramechatron Team Go! and Bad Internet. Some folks also know him as the host of the trivia show Um, Actually. Mike Trapp's got quite the knack for comedy, and he's been involved in a fair few TV series and sketches.\n\nBut let me tell ya somethin' else, mate. While we're on the subject of media, let's talk about gifs for a moment. Gifs, or graphics interchange formats, have become quite the phenomenon in modern society. They're these little animated images that capture a moment or convey a feeling in a looped sequence. They're like a mini-movie, if you will. Gifs have certainly changed the way we communicate and express ourselves online. From funny reactions to iconic scenes, gifs have become a language of their own.\n\nNow, some folks may argue that gifs have made us a bit too reliant on visual cues and quick snippets of content. But hey, I reckon there's no harm in havin' a good laugh or sharin' a moment through a well-chosen gif. Just remember, moderation is key, and let's not forget the beauty of good ol' fashioned conversation, too.\n\nSo, there ya have it, mate! A little bit about Mike Trapp and a whole lot about gifs. Anything else you wanna know or chat about? Fire away!",
